The data and code of "Hypergraph Clustering Based on Modularity Feature Projection for High-order Relationship Community Detection of Microorganisms"

Data:

hy_clu_data: 15-site adjacency matrix (.A), hypergraph incidence matrix (.H), hyperedge weight matrix (.W), original abundance information (.count_site)


Code:

mian_1.m:  The main function of the first step is to calculate the clustering result.

mian_2.m：The main function of the second step calculates three evaluation indicators based on the clustering results.

mian_3.m：The main function of the third step, convergence analysis
